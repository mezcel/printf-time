## printf-time ./Rosary/

#### About:

version: ```v0.3``` Under Construction, Making a Gtk UI (stuck on dynamic resizing)

Yet another installment in my rosary app series. This version is a CLI desktop application written in C (gcc).

* This app uses a CLI display interface.
* Text is rendered from pre-formatted char variables passed through printf() statements
	* it's not pretty, but it is symmetrical and left justified
	* i did not use ```curses``` in order to encourage easier portability and extensibility
* libraries:
	* <stdio.h>		// standard default C library
	* <stdlib.h>	// calloc()/realloc()/malloc(), system(), free()
	* <string.h>	// workhorse header for CLI string manipulation
	* <time.h>
	* "my-csv-parser.h"	// my own homebrew CSV parse header
* Main features:
	* C program syntax
	* Scriptural Rosary
	* Cli Text Display Sideshow (App)
	* CSV db
	* Based off of [python-curses](https://github.com/mezcel/python-curses.git) and [jq-tput-terminal](https://github.com/mezcel/jq-tput-terminal.git)

### Instructions:

* Requires gcc or any tool designed to Compile C.

#### Command line tty version
```bash
## Compile:
gcc main.c -o main

## RUN:
./main

## Use Navigate:
#  [Enter] to navigate forward 1 step
#  "b" and then [Enter] in sequence to navigate backwards
```

#### Desktop GUI window version, Gtk
```./gtk-wip/```
```bash
## Complile:
gcc -Wall -o "mainGtk" "mainGtk.c" `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-2.0`

## RUN:
./mainGtk
```

#### Dependencies:

* Development Environment:
	* gcc (compiler) v6+
	* text editor (code dev)
	* gdb (developer debug)
	* Linux/MinGW/WLS

#### Development Status:

* The main TTY app is complete. (beautification will be continued)
* Working on a integrating the C script into a GTK desktop GUI
* Revisit and embellish the CSV parsing
	* Perhaps embellish my  ```;``` to ```<semicolon>``` workaround

#### Development Perspective:

Display UI:

* printf() text display
* I did not use curses or curses like display
	* My python app, [python-curses](https://github.com/mezcel/python-curses) and bash app [jq-tput-terminal](https://github.com/mezcel/jq-tput-terminal) illustrate application of a clean and sensible CLI UI with a minimalistic aesthetic appeal.

Text DB Parse:

* Unlike my other rosary Apps, I used CSV instead of JSON. It was faster and easier to develop. Coincidently it is also lighter with faster performance, despite my "novice-level" algorithm design.
* CSV files were generated by [json2csv](https://www.csvjson.com/json2csv) from my preexisting JSON db.
* Temporary Workaround: I converted the ```;``` char to ```<semicolon>``` string within each Token attribute string in order to simplify regex parsing.
