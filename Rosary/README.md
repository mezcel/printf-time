## README


#### About:

Description:

* C program syntax
* Scriptural Rosary
* Cli Text Display Sideshow (App)
* CSV db
* Based off of [python-curses](https://github.com/mezcel/python-curses.git) and [jq-tput-terminal](https://github.com/mezcel/jq-tput-terminal.git)

[quick demo recording](https://asciinema.org/a/262232) Not the latest version.

Use Instruction:

* Requires gcc or any tool designed to Compile C.

```bash
## Compile:
gcc main.c -o main

## RUN:
./main

## Use Navigate:
#  [Enter] to navigate forward 1 step
#  "b" and then [Enter] in sequence to navigate backwards
```

Dependencies:

* gcc (compiler)
* text editor (code dev)
* gdb (developer debug)

#### Development Status:

* The main app is complete
* Continued development will be on beautification and display UI.
* Incorporate PFM and other fiesta/date related flags and events

#### Development Perspective:

Display UI:

* just test aligned printf() text display
* I did not use curses or curses like display
	* My python app, [python-curses](https://github.com/mezcel/python-curses) and bash app [jq-tput-terminal](https://github.com/mezcel/jq-tput-terminal) illustrate application of a clean and sensible CLI UI with a minimalistic aesthetic appeal.

Text DB Parse:

* Unlike my other rosary Apps, I used CSV instead of JSON. It was faster and easier to develop. Coincidently it is also lighter with faster performance, despite my "novice-level" algorithm design.

* CSV files were generated by [json2csv](https://www.csvjson.com/json2csv) from my preexising JSON db.

* Temporary Workaround: I converter the ```;``` char to ```<semicolon>``` string within each Token attribute string in order to simplify regex parsing.

Dev Environment (GCC Development):

* Gcc ```v6.9``` The default on Debian 9
* Gdb debugger
* Developed on WLS for convenient migration into MinGw.
