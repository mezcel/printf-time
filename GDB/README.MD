## GDB

[manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/documentation/) - gnu.org

Iv your not using GDB on the CLI or a traditional IDE, you can uses this Atom.io package, [dbg-gdb](https://atom.io/packages/dbg-gdb)

### The neat thing is ...

The compiler can re-render the code more efficiently than what the User did. (every case varies)

It can detect if despite all the algorithm calculations performed by the user, were those calculations relevant to the actual mechanical number crunching, and vica versa.

Sometime the ASM will illustrate this, but ultimately the optimizations will be in the executable binary.
