		Anonymous Gregorian algorithm, Easter algorithms
		// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computus#Anonymous_Gregorian_algorithm

		"A New York correspondent" submitted this algorithm for determining the Gregorian Easter to the journal Nature in 1876. It has been reprinted many times, e.g., in 1877 by Samuel Butcher in The Ecclesiastical Calendar, in 1916 by Arthur Downing in The Observatory, in 1922 by H. Spencer Jones in General Astronomy, in 1977 by the Journal of the British Astronomical Association, in 1977 by The Old Farmer's Almanac, in 1988 by Peter Duffett-Smith in Practical Astronomy with your Calculator, and in 1991 by Jean Meeus in Astronomical Algorithms. Because of the Meeusâ€™ book citation, that is also called "Meeus/Jones/Butcher" algorithm.
