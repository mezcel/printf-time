# asm

Assembly code equivalent of main.c

```bash
gcc -S -o mainasm main.c -lm
```

the assembly output is a *.s file or just the -o file executable

## Note:

The ASM is just for demo illustration, I dont have an application for this other than demonstration and observational curiosity.

The enclosed ASMs are from different Intel x64 Processors each using a different OS and different GCC version.
