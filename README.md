#### Two Independent Apps Contained in this Repo:

Future plans to combine the 2 and remove a lot of the independent bloat features. This app is an exercise in portability and extensibility.

1. __PFM-Calculator__:

	* Calculate Easter Day from the Paschal Full Moon date
	* a lot of extra/optional output display related bloat (just for jollies)
	* [asciinema demo video link](https://asciinema.org/a/232779)

2. __Rosary__:  [New)]( ./Rosary/ )

	* A basic CLI Rosary using (CSV to Struct Array) array db.
