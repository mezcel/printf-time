* Refactoring object libraries
* Gradually making documentation readable

##### Runtime Environment

* [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) or Linux
* Command line interface (CLI) / Shell Terminal
* Xorg (Debian linux) or Xlaunch (Win10/WLS)

##### Developer Environment (debug/mod)

* [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) or Linux (x86 or x64)
	* this app was developed on Debian WLS and tested on a real Linux
* GCC v6+
* Glade (a gui drawing tool)
* any text editor (I use Geany for everything)
	* Geany macros for quick and easy gtk3 development
