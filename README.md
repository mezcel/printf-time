# printf-time

## About:

A scripture rosary written in C/GCC for the GTK and the TTY. It uses both a CSV and a JSON Database. The CSV contains NAB quotes in English and the JSON contains Vulgate quotes in Latin.

Developed for use on Linux or WLS.
* All availble features work on Debian Linux and WLS.
* Uses [json-c](https://github.com/json-c/json-c) from the Debian repo.
	* Only the latin translation needs json.

* Also works on Win10 with Visual Studio C++ installed.
	* The Gtk feature does not work outside of WLS on Win10.
	* The compiled ```.exe``` works in Win10 Powershell.
	* The UI is limited where only the ```enter``` and ```q``` keys works, and the user can only navigate forward. No changes occur when the screen is resized.
## GUI Options:

> This app can be run within a terminal or a desktop environment gui.

| English CLI Version | English GTK3 Version |

## Compile on Debian

```sh
## build and compile everything

make

## the following executable binaries will be generated:
## 	ttyRosary and gtkRosary
```

### Run
```sh
## TTY App

./ttyRosary		## NAB English, using a CSV database
./ttyRosary -v		## Vulgate Latin, using a JSON database

## GTK App

./gtkRosary		## NAB English
./gtkRosary -v		## Vulgate Latin
```

### Dependencies

If you get a compile error from the make build: ```#include <json-c/json.h>```, then use ```make debian``` to install potentially missing dependencies. This applies only to compilation on Debian based distros.

```sh
## Get dependencies for Debian 9 or newer
make debian

## debian libjson-c dependencies
sudo apt install autotools-dev debhelper dh-autoreconf dh-exec

## debian stretch (libs)
sudo apt install libjson-c-dev libjson-c-doc libjson-c3

## man page (manual intervention required)
sudo apt install groff pandoc
```

## Compile on Win10
* [Configure VS Code for Microsoft C++](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-msvc)
* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#other)

```ps1
## clean previous builds
del *.obj
del *.exe

## Compile and build
cl sources\my_calendar.c
cl sources\my_csv_structs.c
cl sources\my_tty_ui.c

cl mainTTY.c my_calendar.obj my_csv_structs.obj my_tty_ui.obj

## run
.\mainTTY.exe

## Project Status:

### v0.3.6.? (current development)

* Refactored the code to allow for Win10 compilation.

### Runtime Environment

* Linux, [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) or Win10 Powershell with Visual Studio C++
* Command line interface (CLI) / Shell Terminal
* Xorg (Debian linux) or Xlaunch (Win10/WLS)

### Developer Environment (debug/mod)

* [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) or Linux (x86 or x64)
	* this app was developed on Debian WLS and tested on a real Linux
* GCC v6+
* Glade (a gui drawing tool)
* any text editor (I use Geany for everything)
	* Geany macros for quick and easy gtk3 development
	* compile:	gcc -Wall -c "%f" `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0` -export-dynamic
	* build:	gcc -Wall -o "%e" "%f" `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0` -export-dynamic

Win10

```sh
## Compile in Debian and make it usable on a Win10

sudo apt install mingw-w64
i686-w64-mingw32-gcc "main.c" -o "my-executable-file.exe"

## Compile in Win10 with MinGW installed

gcc "main.c" -o "my-executable-file.exe "
```
