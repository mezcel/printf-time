## printf-time

version: ```v0.2.1```

#### Apps Contained in the Repo:

1. __PFM-Calculator__:
	* Calculate Easter Day from the Paschal Full Moon date
	* a lot of extra/optional output display related bloat (just for jollies)
	* intended as a standalone or portable app
	* [asciinema demo video link](https://asciinema.org/a/232779)

2. __Rosary__: (New)
	* A basic CLI Rosary using (CSV to Struct Array) array db.
	* Intended as a standalone app
	* Main features are working and complete
	* Display UI works but ```beautification``` is under construction
	* [quick demo recording](https://asciinema.org/a/262232)  ** Older version: ```v0.2.?``` **

### Future Development:

* UI display beautification for the Rosary
	* kinda hard since it is just printf(), but so far the word wrap is functional.
* Integrate PFM into the Rosary in order to make it more like the rosary apps I made using the other programming languages.
	* so far, only the weekday flags are up and running
