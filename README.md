development branch: ```v0.3.1```

#### Two Independent Apps Contained in this Repo:

The plan is to integrate ```./PFM-Calculator``` as a feature functionality of ```./Rosary```.

This app is an exercise in portability and extensibility.

1. __PFM-Calculator__:

	* [./PFM-Calculator/](./PFM-Calculator/)
	* Calculate Easter Day from the Paschal Full Moon date
	* a lot of extra/optional output display related bloat (just for jollies)
	* [outdated demo preview](https://asciinema.org/a/232779)

2. __Rosary__:  [ ** New ** ](./Rosary)

	* [./Rosary/](./Rosary)
	* A basic CLI Rosary using (CSV to Struct Array) array db.
	* ```beautification``` is still under construction
	* [outdated demo preview](https://asciinema.org/a/262232)
	* GTK Option (under construction)
		* Desktop GUI
