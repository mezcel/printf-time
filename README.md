# printf-time (under construction)

C syntax which calculates Easter day and Paschal Full Moon. 

version: ```0.1```

#### Description:

A C program which uses C syntax and the GCC compiler to caculate the date of the Paschal Full Moon (PMF) and the date of Easter Day.

Tested on Linux. I am not sure (yet :/) how Windows handles the [POSIX](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/) date time format between different C compilers.

This app is a C refresher as well as an exercise to learn the how to use the CLI as an IDE, debug in GDB, and inspecting assembly code in the desktop environment.

Output Modes:

* This Year Date				(working)
* Upcoming Year Date			(working)
* Any Year ( 1900AD ~ 3000AD )	(working but not appied)

#### Feature algorithms:

* Gauss Easter Algorithm
* Annonomous Easter Algorithm
* Meeus Easter Algorithm
* Paschal Full Moon (PFM) -- *Just the full moon day*

#### Example CLI Output:

The next Paschal Ful Moon:
	This year
	In 44.151701 days
	On Thursday 18 April 2019

Gauss Output:
	Sunday 21, April 2019 -- Gregorian Calendar, mixed var array

Anonymous Output:
	Sunday 21, April 2019 -- Gregorian Calendar, mixed var array

Meeus Output:
	 15, April 2019 -- Julian Calendar, mixed var array

Paschal Full Moon (PFM) Output:
	Thursday 18, April 2019 -- Gregorian Calendar, mixed var array

PFM output as a single char array value:
	String array: 20190418

This next last line will ne used as a string to input into Bash for any futher POSIX date calculations.

### Developer Rant:

This is (way way way) too bloated for what it is.

The quick and dirty would have just been a ~10 liner with a ```return date char```, but I felt like making an embellished personal C refresher.

### MinGW & MSYS

GCC and G++ is just GNU. [Windows GNU](https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/releases/)
