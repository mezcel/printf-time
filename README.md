## printf-time

version: ```v0.2.1```

#### About:

Yet another installment in my rosary app series. This version is a CLI desktop application written in C (gcc).

* I decided to stick with a CLI display interface.
* This is the most minimalist of all of my different program language versions.
* The script is a more bloated than it needs to be, but in doing so, it it acts as a review & reference guide for using structs, char-strings manipulation, and illustrating pointer/memory/addressing use-cases.

#### Apps Contained in the Repo:

1. __PFM-Calculator__:
	* Calculate Easter Day and the Paschal Full Moon
	* a lot of extra/optional output display related bloat
	* intended as a standalone or portable app
	* [asciinema demo video link](https://asciinema.org/a/232779)

2. __Rosary__:
	* A basic CLI Rosary using (CSV to Struct Array) array db.
	* Intended as a standalone app
	* Main features are working and complete
	* Display UI works but ```beautification``` is under construction
	* [quick demo recording](https://asciinema.org/a/262232)  Not the latest version.

### Future Development:

* UI display beautification
* Integrate PFM into the Rosary in order to make it more like the rosary apps I made using the other programming languages.
