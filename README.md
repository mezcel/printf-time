# printf-time

### About:

development branch: ```v0.3.3```

This is a scriptural rosary slideshow. The text database is CSV, the program is C, and the UI is Gtk built with from an Xml.

### Inspiration:

This is the 5th program language version in my Rosary App series. Features used in this app are based on previous other versions of the app.

Previous versions were:
* [C#/MySql/.NET](https://github.com/mezcel/rosary.net) (a WinForm and a WPF/WCF version),
* [JqueryMobile/Json](https://github.com/mezcel/electron-container) (an Electron and Heroku version),
* [Bash/Json](https://github.com/mezcel/jq-tput-terminal) (shell on Arch & Debian),
* [Python/Json](https://github.com/mezcel/python-curses),
* and now the [C/CSV](https://github.com/mezcel/printf-time) version.

### 2 Gui options:

##### 1. A TTY/CLI version

The user navigates with with typed instructions. Press [enter] key or the key sequence ["b" + enter] to navigate forwards or backwards.

* Terminal screen app ( printf and key inputs )
* [stop point, animated demo](https://asciinema.org/a/266585.svg) ```v0.3.3.?```
	* install, compile, start, run, exit

##### 2. A GTK/GUI version

The user navigates with widget objects.

* Desktop window app ( buttons, labels, progressbars, and other misc. widgets )
* [outdated screenshot](img/screenshot.gif) ```v0.3```
